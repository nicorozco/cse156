UDP File Transfer with Reliability (Sliding Window Protocol)

This project implements a reliable file transfer protocol over UDP. The client reads and sends a file to the server in chunks, while the server acknowledges received data and reconstructs the file. The implementation simulates real-world packet loss and uses a sliding window mechanism for retransmission and flow control.

Features

Sliding Window protocol with window size 5
Per-packet retransmission up to 5 times
Simulated packet/ACK loss via dropPacket()
Timeout-based retransmission using select()
Handles duplicate packets and out-of-order delivery
Graceful EOF handling and file reconstruction

Usage

Server ./myserver

port: Port to listen on (e.g. 8080)
lossRate: Simulated packet loss percentage (e.g. 10 means 10%)
Client ./myclient <server_ip> <server_port> <input_file_path> <output_file_path_on_server>

Sends a file to the server at server_ip:server_port
Server reconstructs the file at the specified path
