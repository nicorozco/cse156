< "Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."

> "No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."
> 
> "We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"

> "How did he come?"
> 
> "In answer to an advertisement."
> 
> "Was he the only applicant?"
> 
> "No, I had a dozen."
> 
> "Why did you pick him?"
> 
> "Because he was handy and would come cheap."
> 
> "At half wages, in fact."
> 
> "Yes."
> 
> "What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"
> 
> "Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."
> 
> Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"
> 
> "Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."
> 
> "Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with you?"

< My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.
---
> "Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."
914c950
< "You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.
---
> "That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."
916c952
< "Yes, it would be as well."
---
> "Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"
918c954
< "And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious."
---
> "I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."
920c956
< "Why serious?"
---
> "As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."
922c958
< "A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night."
---
> "What are you going to do, then?" I asked.
924c960
< "At what time?"
---
> "To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
926c962
< "Ten will be early enough."
---
> "Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"
928c964
< "I shall be at Baker Street at ten."
---
> "I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."
930c966
< "Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.
---
> "Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"

< I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.
---
> We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.
> 
> "Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand."
> 
> "Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.
> 
> "Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before."
> 
> "Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."
> 
> "Not him."
> 
> "What then?"
> 
> "The knees of his trousers."
> 
> "And what did you see?"
> 
> "What I expected to see."
> 
> "Why did you beat the pavement?"
> 
> "My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."
> 
> The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.
> 
> "Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.

> 
> We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.
> 
> "You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.
> 
> "Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.
> 
> "I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"
> 
> The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. Aand yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.

< "Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.

McCis arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury."
1356c1430
< "On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.
---
> "It was a confession," I ejaculated.
1358c1432
< "From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
---
> "No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."
1360c1434,1436
< "The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."
---
> "Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark."
> 
> "On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and ly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge.

< I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence.
< 
< It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.

Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.

On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy."
< 
< "And what did you learn from him?"
< 
< "Nothing."
< 
< "Could he throw no light?"
< 
< "None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart."

< "I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner."
< 
< "Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered."

< Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. "We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row."

> Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. "We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was aay what did you hope to arrive at through this?"

---

4085c4147
< "Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her."
---
> "And how?"
4087c4149
< "Well, it is a possible supposition."
---
> "In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.' Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach."
4089c4151
< "You think so, too?"
---
> "Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important," said he.
4091c4153
< "I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?"

> "Ha! you find it so?"
4093c4155

---
> "Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."
4095c4157
< "Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?"
---
> Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"
4097c4159
< "Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife."

< "The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.

It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unming the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.

> "I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.

Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.

< United States, cut off from English manufactures as during the
< Revolution, built up home industries to meet the unusual call for iron,

< demands from ordinary markets. Iron foundries and textile mills sprang
< up as in the night; hundreds of business men invested fortunes in
< industrial enterprises so essential to the military needs of the
< government; and the people at large fell into the habit of buying
< American-made goods again. As the London _Times_ tersely observed of the
< Americans, "their first war with England made them independent; their

< 
< In recognition of this state of affairs, the tariff of 1816 was

< if they wished to progress at all, were compelled to progress not by
< ceasing to be wage-earners but by improving the conditions under which
< all the wage-earners of the country lived and worked."
< 
< The disappearance of the free land, President Roosevelt went on to say,
< also produced "a crass inequality in the bargaining relation of the

< coal-mining and coal-carrying companies which employed their tens of
< thousands could easily dispense with the services of any particular

< portions of the epidermis into the underlying connective tissue, as may
< occur in wounds by needles, awls, forks, or thorns. The implanted
< epidermis proliferates and forms a small cyst. They are met with chiefly
< on the palmar aspect of the fingers, and vary in size from a split pea
< to a cherry. The treatment consists in removing them by dissection.
< 
< _Parasitic cysts_ are produced by the growth within the tissues of
< cyst-forming parasites, the best known being the taenia echinococcus,
< which gives rise to the _hydatid cyst_. The liver is by far the most
< common site of hydatid cysts in the human subject.
< 
< With regard to the further life-history of hydatids, the living elements
< of the cyst may die and degenerate, or the cyst may increase in size
< until it ruptures. As a result of pyogenic infection the cyst may be
< converted into an abscess.
< 
< The _clinical features_ of hydatids vary so much with their situation
< and size, that they are best discussed with the individual organs. In
< general it may be said that there is a slow formation of a globular,
< elastic, fluctuating, painless swelling. Fluctuation is detected when
< the cyst approaches the surface, and it is then also that percussion
< may elicit the "hydatid thrill" or fremitus. This thrill is not often
< obtainable, and in any case is not pathognomonic of hydatids, as it may
< be elicited in ascites and in other abdominal cysts. Pressure of the

> _Pathological Anatomy._--The wall of the cyst is composed of fibrous
> tissue closely adherent to or fused with the surrounding tissues, so
> that it cannot be shelled out. There is no endothelial lining, and the
> fibrous tissue of the wall is in immediate contact with the colloid
> material in the interior, which appears to be derived by a process of
> degeneration from the surrounding connective tissue. In the region of
> the knee the ganglion is usually multilocular, and consists of a
> meshwork of fibrous tissue, the meshes of which are occupied by colloid
> material.

< features are common to all perforations caused by bullets.
< 
< Pistol wounds only produce dangerous effects when fired at close range,

< 
< Pistol-shot wounds of _joints_ and _soft parts_ are seldom of serious
< import apart from the risk of haemorrhage and of infection.
< 
< _Treatment._--The treatment of wounds of the soft parts consists in
< purifying the wounds of entrance and exit and the surrounding skin, and
< in providing for drainage if this is indicated.
< 
< There being no urgency for the removal of the bullet, time should be
< taken to have it localised by the X-rays, preferably by stereoscopic

< a dislocation or the incision of a whitlow; or in those who have rapidly

< veins, as is shown by the fact that it is relieved by elevation of the
< limb. When the whole length of the main trunk of the great saphena is
< implicated, the pressure in the vein is high and the patient suffers a
< good deal of pain and discomfort. When, on the contrary, the upper part
< of the saphena and its valves are intact, and only the more distal veins
< are involved, the pressure is not so high and there is comparatively
< little suffering. The usual complaint is of a sense of weight and
< fulness in the limb after standing or walking, sometimes accompanied by
< actual pain, from which relief is at once obtained by raising the limb.
< Cramp-like pains in the muscles are often associated with varix of the
< deep veins.
< 
< The dilated and tortuous vein can be readily seen and felt when the
< patient is examined in the upright posture. In advanced cases, bead-like
< swellings are sometimes to be detected over the position of the valves,
< and, on running the fingers along the course of the vessel, a firm
< ridge, due to periphlebitis, may be detected on each side of the vein.
< When the limb is oedematous, the outline of the veins is obscured, but
< they can be identified on palpation as gutter-like tracks. When large
< veins are implicated, a distinct impulse on coughing may be seen to pass

> Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the
> ambulance station on the field of Borodino. His feverish state and the
> inflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctor's
> 
> opinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with
> pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that
> his temperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning.
> The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had
> remained in the caleche, but at Mytishchi the wounded man himself
> asked to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his
> removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose
> consciousness. When he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a
> long time motionless with closed eyes. Then he opened them and
> whispered softly: "And the tea?" His remembering such a small detail
> of everyday life astonished the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew's pulse,
> and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved. He
> was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did
> not die now, he would do so a little later with greater suffering.
> Timokhin, the red-nosed major of Prince Andrew's regiment, had
> joined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him, having been
> wounded in the leg at the battle of Borodino. They were accompanied by
> a doctor, Prince Andrew's valet, his coachman, and two orderlies.
> 
> They gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking
> with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to
> understand and remember something.
> 
> "I don't want any more. Is Timokhin here?" he asked.
> 
> Timokhin crept along the bench to him.
> 
> "I am here, your excellency."
> 
> "How's your wound?"
> 
> "Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?"
> 
> Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.
> 
> "Couldn't one get a book?" he asked.
> 
> "What book?"
> 
> "The Gospels. I haven't one."
> 
> The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he
> was feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly
> but reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him
> as he was uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted
> the cloak with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the
> noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began
> examining that dreadful place. The doctor was very much displeased
> about something and made a change in the dressings, turning the
> wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and
> delirious from the agony. He kept asking them to get him the book
> and put it under him.
> 
> "What trouble would it be to you?" he said. "I have not got one.

> The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.
> 
> "You fellows have no conscience," said he to the valet who was
