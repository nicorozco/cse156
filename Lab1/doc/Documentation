Usage: 
	./main <hostname> <IP Address of host server:Port Number(optional)/path to resource> -h (optional)

To utilize this program, 3 arguments can be provided: 

	1.) Hostname - Specifies the domain name of the target server(www.google.com). This allows the client to request the specific website hosted on a shared server. Note: the host name must be follow the DNS rules, else it will be rejected by the program

	2.) URL: 
          - IP Address: - Identifies the server hosting the requested website. By default, the program connects to port 80, the standard port for HTTP Traffic. 
	 - Port (Optional): If you'd like to specify a different port that is allowed, otherwise as before the deault will remain 80
	- Path: The allows us to request the specific resource you want to access. Note: If not path is provided the path will default to the root path (/)
	
	3.) -h flag (Optional): this option is utilized to request only the HTTP headers of server response. When enabled, the program prints the headers directly to the terminal and omits the body of the response. print to the terminal.
 
Internal Design:
	####Structure of the Program####:
	- Options are provided by the users, the program parses and set's the appropriate field
	- The program then utilizes these inputs to create a connection with the server:
		2.) Create a client socket, for the purpose of connecting,sending and recieving message between server
		3.) Create a server socket struture and input the provided arguments to connect to the server
		4.) HTTP Request Creation:
			- if the h flag was provided we create a http request message with the "HEAD" method to only recieved the headers, 
			by design we set the connection to close to ensure our code isn't remained in a state of recieving once the server has finished sending the request
			- By Default: the client will create a http request message with the "GET" method
	
		5.) Send the HTTP Request out of the client file descriptor 
		6.) Run a while look to recievied from the client socket until not further bytes are recieved
			- H Option:
				If the h-option is provided we print directly from the buffer into the terminal
			- Default: 
				The program will store the data into a vector as it recieved from the socket
	
			- Stoping Condition for Loop:
				-To ensure we stop when the socket no longer recievies data, we parse the headers
			 we parse the headers to know the content-lenght field
				- Since our client doesn't support chunk-enconding we also check for this header:
					- if this header is found, we terminate and return error code 11
				- Reaching the stoping condition:
					- As we recieved data from the socket, we compare the bytes recieved with the content-lenght:
						- if these values are equal we break from recieving
		7.) Process the Information Recievd:
			- Create an input stream from the vector
				- extract the statuscode, if the status code is greater than 400 we return 9

		8.) Outputting the Data:
			- We extract the data from the full body vector into a vector only containing the body of the message
			- Reverse the Data & Output to a file


Functions:
	- bool isValidIPVv4Format();
		- Function utilizing regex to ensure the IP Address provided is an argument
		is in compliance with IPv4 standard, return true if valid else return false
		if invalid IPv4 Address
	- bool isValidHost();
		- Function utilizing regex to ensure the host name provided adheres to DNS regulations
		ensuring the hostname is able to be request in HTTP Request
	- bool isValidPath();
		- Function to ensure the path provided for the specific file is valid by being a certain size
		under 2000 character and able to utilize certain characters.
